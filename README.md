# A sample Python project README file

This is the README file for the project.

The file should use UTF-8 encoding and be written using [Github-flavored Markdown Text](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/). It will be displayed as the package repository home page on [GitHub](https://github.com/), and should be written for that purpose. 

Note that, if and when the package is to be distributed via [PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi)r, it will be necessary to convert this file to [reStructuredText](http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html) format. [Pandoc](http://pandoc.org/) is the preferred tool for this task.

Typical contents for this file would include an overview of the project, basic usage examples, etc. Generally, including the project changelog in here is not a good idea, although a simple "What's New" section for the most recent version may be appropriate.
